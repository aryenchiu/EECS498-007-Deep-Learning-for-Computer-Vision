## Course Description
* This course is a deep dive into details of neural-network based deep learning methods for computer vision. During this course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision.
* Its course arrangement is similar to famous CS231n in Stanford, but this area develops super fast, and this course has newer lecture videos published in 2019.

## Content
* The repo is my implementation of six assignments in FA2020 courses. 
* The assignments includes many topics and most of them focus on the implementation details about building blocks of the models instead of just throwing inputs into a blackbox to see how powerful deep learning models are. 
* After finishing these assignments students can understand the implementation details in each model, such as how to implement back-propagation in FC, CNN and RNN without PyTorch.
    * A1
        * Basic tensor manipulation using PyTorch
        * k nearest neighbors

### [My Notes](https://hackmd.io/uPkncntWREKvijdfrOMqeg)
* Most contents came from lecture slides, important concepts that lecturer mentioned in the video and some of my understandings.
