## Instructor
[Justin Johnson](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/)

## Contents
* This course is a deep dive into details of neural-network based deep learning methods for computer vision. During this course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision.
* Its course arrangement is similar to famous CS231n in Stanford, but this area develops super fast, and this course has newer lecture videos published in 2019.

### [My Notes](https://hackmd.io/uPkncntWREKvijdfrOMqeg)
* most of content comes from lecture slides, important concepts that lecturer mentioned in the video and some of my understanding.
